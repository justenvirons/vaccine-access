# Background
CCDPH and other local health providers across the country are seeking ways to increase COVID-19 vaccine coverage throughout their jurisdictions and plan ahead for broader vaccine eligibility and boosters later this summer and/or fall. It has become increasingly clear that encouraging people to vaccinate will require both identifying and overcoming a wide range of potential barriers that influence both the supply of and demand for COVID-19 vaccine. This brief report aims to assess variations in transportation- or  access-related barriers to vaccination opportunities across CCDPH communities and evaluate the extent to which these barriers may  influence coverage rates. 

The report provides a brief account of the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine providers and on-hand vaccine inventory across the four CCDPH districts and with special attention paid to the 32 priority communities which have experienced relatively high levels of COVID-19 burden throughout the pandemic. The  

# Part I. CCDPH COVID-19 vaccine providers
We begin by mapping the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine providers. The epidemiological unit at CCDPH has developed and regularly maintains a master list of COVID-19 vaccine providers that operate within the department's jurisdiction. The master list is informed by the departmentâ€™s own curated partner list as well as reports that are regularly downloaded from the three vaccine tracking platforms, namely: I-CARE, VaccineFinder and VTrckS. Each of the downloaded reports provides a window into one or more facets of the CCDPH vaccine distribution program such that, when examined collectively, offer a novel window into the flow of vaccines throughout CCDPH's jurisdiction. The latest version of the master list (produced 5/21/2021), includes information on over 500 providers operating  within 120 municipalities across four CCDPH districts (which excludes Chicago, Evanston, Oak Park, Skokie, and Stickney Township).

# Community population characteristics
Since the beginning of the pandemic over one year ago, demographic characteristics including age, race and relative prevalence of comorbidities have contributed to the overall COVID-19 burden experienced by communities. The recent pandemic provides yet another stark reminder that public health opportunity and performance are not distributed evenly within Chicago and throughout suburban Cook County.
